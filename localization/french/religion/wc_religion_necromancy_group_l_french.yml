 throsic_desc:0 "Many spirits of the fallen Drust have been banished into an offshoot plane within the Emerald Nightmare that they later named Thros, where they cultivated a potent form of death magic with bastardized druidic elements. This form of magic resulted from numerous attempts to bewitch the souls of fallen Drust into constructs to use against human settlers. Following this, the Throsic form of necromancy prefers binding the souls of the dead into durable constructs, while the traditional form of corpse reanimation is rarer. Its influence towards the wildlife and the living is usually perpetuated by the local witch covens. The most loyal of Throsian witches can also ascend into Matrons, an incorporeal banshee-like creature, through a ritualistic act of slitting their own throat in ultimate devotion to their horrific masters."
