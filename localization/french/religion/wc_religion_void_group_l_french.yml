 void_group:0 "Vide"
 void_group_adj:0 "du Vide"
 void_group_adherent:0 "adepte du Vide"
 void_group_adherent_plural:0 "adeptes du Vide"
 void_group_desc:0 "Despite the fact that many think that $void_group_adherent_plural$ are nothing more than crazy maniacs, this is far from the truth. They learn to control Void magic without defiling their minds. Unlike $light_group_adherent_plural$, they're more tolerant and don't believe in only one way."

 #void-Group Faiths
 voidfarer:0 "K'areshi"
 voidfarer_adj:0 "k'areshi"
 voidfarer_adherent:0 "k'areshi"
 voidfarer_adherent_plural:0 "k'areshis"
 voidfarer_desc:0 "While dangerous, void magic can be carefully used for the benefit of its users and their allies. Some Void practitioners have devoted their lives to the study and use of the void for good, such as the denizens of the Telogrus Rift, although there are some that are much more morally ambiguous than their peers, such as the K'areshi ethereals. Nevertheless, they can all enjoy the benefits of the Void without interference from the Old Gods, but still risk being corrupted by the malevolent whispers."
 
 forsaken_cult:0 "Ombres oubliées"
 forsaken_cult_adj:0 "oubliée"
 forsaken_cult_adherent:0 "oublié"
 forsaken_cult_adherent_plural:0 "oubliés"
 forsaken_cult_desc:0 "A heretical group of shadow magic practitioners, the Forgotten Shadow believe that dark energy practitioners are just as vital to the survival of life and reality as wielders of the Light. The cult preaches balance, mandating that shadow priests must never forget the dangers being corrupted by the dark energies they manipulate, for it is often difficult to find one's way back to the shadow from the deep reaches of the darkness."
