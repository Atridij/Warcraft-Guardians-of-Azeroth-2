 illidari_adj:0 "vindicatrice"
 illidari_adherent:0 "vindicatoriste"
 illidari_adherent_plural:0 "vindicatoristes"
 illidari_desc:0 "The powers of fel can be tempting to all living beings in the universe, but there are those who use it as a tool to fight the evils that lurk throughout creation, rather than for personal gain or destruction. Though these individuals can often be found guilty of similar crimes as those of power-hungry warlocks and demons, they see any suffering inflicted as means to a greater end, an end greater than themselves and their sacrifices. Though more realistically benevolent than most demons and warlocks, society will seek to reject them and their cruel, if effective, methods nonetheless."

 orcish_fel_adj:0 "corruptique"

 orcish_fel_desc:0 "Whether its power is found through contracts between warlocks and demonic lords or through the blood of a certain Annihilan, fel threatens to corrupt completely and absolutely. Though famous for its fel-fueled crusade, the Burning Legion is not responsible for all of those who find their way to fel corruption, and those who fall on their own find themselves craving power unending, usually until their very undoing. The fel-corrupted are forever hungry for power and control, even if it should cost them their soul or the lives of their people."
